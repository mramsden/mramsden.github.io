I am a mobile software developer based in London. I am the head of development at [Smile Machine](http://smilemachine.com); a full service agency founded in 2010; where I oversee the development of all of our software projects.

I have been working in the software development industry since 2008 with experience ranging from academic research departments, up to large scale enterprise development and back into a smaller start up style environment.

My experience ranges from creating web based applications based in PHP, Java, Ruby and Perl, to creating native mobile applications for both iOS and Android.

I have been well and truly bitten by the mobile bug and am fascinated by the opportunities and challenges presented by mobile software.

Outside of work I volunteer at the [Wizzie Wizzie Coding Club](http://wizziewizzie.org). At W2C2 we show children between 6 - 12 an introduction to computer programming through both [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) through to the rudiments of writing code in an editor using [Kids Ruby](http://kidsruby.com).
