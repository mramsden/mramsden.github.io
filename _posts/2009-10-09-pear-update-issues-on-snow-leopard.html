<p>So I just came across some weirdness on my default install of PHP on Snow Leopard. I wanted to install the latest version of PHPUnit in order to carry out some testing, but it was asking me to update PEAR. </p>
<p>So I ran the usual PEAR update command;<br />
[code language="shell"]<br />
$ sudo pear upgrade pear<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This appeared to run without any issues. But subsequently whenever I attempted to run PEAR I was greeted with the following error message;<br />
[code language="shell"]<br />
/usr/local/bin/pear: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I took a look inside the offending file as it is just a simple command to run the PEAR script. It looked like this;<br />
[code language="shell"]<br />
pear /usr/lib/php/pearcmd.php<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Obviously the script was infinitely attempting to spawn itself causing the resource temporarily unavailable error. So the simple fix was to change the script to the following;<br />
[code language="shell"]<br />
php /usr/lib/php/pearcmd.php $@<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure why the script changed when I upgraded but it appeared to. I figured I should pop this note up in case anyone else gets caught out, or indeed I forget and get caught out again. Any insight on why this might have happened would be appreciated.</p>
